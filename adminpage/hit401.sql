(2, 'Enhancing airport screening using a deep neural network algorithm', 'The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has a complex security program that requires officers to visually search travelers’ baggage for prohibited objects, or cues to such objects, which may pose a threat to security. This visual search - when conducted by humans - is difficult to successfully complete as it may result in either a false positive (finding a non-threatening object) or a false negative (missing a threatening object); indeed, a recent assessment reported that TSA screeners missed 95% percent of mock explosive and banned weapons smuggled through checkpoints (ABC News, 2015). It is possible that effective screening may be achieved via the coupling of human screeners and detection technology. Here, the proposal is to design an algorithm that analyses x-ray images during baggage (and/or person) screening to automatically give an alert when a potential threat is detected. The challenge is to utilise deep neural networks to aid with image and object recognition; specifically, to detect the presence of a threat within compact, cluttered and diverse baggage content in a timely-manner, thus providing travel safety assurances.\n\nPotential issues that require solutions:\n1.	Utilise a machine learning framework – based on convolutional neural networks, for example - that processes images captured either by checkpoint baggage screeners or body scanners then detects threatening objects. These objects are usually intentionally obscured by other items, thus a computer algorithm that automatically identifies threat is useful in reducing the risk of misdetection during the physical inspection of the x-ray image. The detection must be rapid and accurate, potentially with a better performance rate than that of human screeners, in order to reduce the amount of work done by a human inspector.\n2.	Develop an algorithm that identifies regions within the images captured either by checkpoint baggage screeners or body scanners that may include threatening objects. This alternative solution enables the human screener to then review only the alerted regions of the image, thus not only reducing the amount of time they need to scan the entire image for a potential threat, but also enabling them to focus all cognitive effort on alerted regions.\n3.	Minimise the false alarm rate when detecting non-threatening objects in images captured either by checkpoint baggage screeners or body scanners. This point is pertinent as it would reduce the need for checkpoint workers to pull passengers aside for further inspection.', 1, 1, 0, '', 0),

Augmented-reality may serve as an effective tool that enhances the driving performance of young drivers by graphically overlaying visual information - that young drivers may miss or find difficulty calculating in their environment - onto the real world. The challenge here is, therefore, to design an augmented-reality interface that can increase the situational awareness (ability to recognise task-relevant items), and, thus, improve the decision- making (safe driving) of young drivers without increasing their cognitive or perceptual workload.\n\nPotential issues that require solutions:\n1.

The energy use of buildings in Darwin can be more than this amount as Darwin has a tropical savanna climate. Moreover, average temperatures in the Top End are expected to increase by around 1 °C by 2030 for medium greenhouse gas emissions and by around 3.2 °C by 2070 for high emissions, and this will increase the energy consumption of buildings significantly by air-conditioning systems. Using less energy for cooling makes houses less expensive to live in while reducing their environmental impact. Other fundamentals of green building help buildings last longer, give them healthier interiors and helped reduce the natural resources needed to construct them. Therefore, it is imperative to move towards zero energy buildings in Northern Territory. The simple definition of zero energy building is that the total amount of energy used by the building on an annual basis is equal to the amount of renewable energy created on the site. To achieve this goal, we need to design very efficient buildings and renewable energy systems for the buildings, particularly in Darwin which has a unique weather condition.

The recent Global Financial Crisis originated in 2008 has called attention to the importance of the default risk of financial intuitions.

A broadcaster seeking to supply broadband service cannot assess the value of a particular band of spectrum unless it knows whether an adjacent frequency band is also available.

Probably the most active auctions in the world are those conducted to link ads to Internet search terms.

Consequently, when the security procedure interferes with the primary task, a user may ignore or even interfere with the security measures, since the user is more focused on the task and the end rewards associated with completion of the primary task (Adams et al. 1999).\nThe burden of compliance with security tasks on employees has been identified as one of the major factors leading to non-compliance (Furnell et al. 2012a; Leach 2003; Vance et al. 2012a).

(181, 'Life cycle assessment for sustainable mining: Gold mining ', 'Mining occurs in all states of Australia, nation has over 350 operating mines, producing 19 useful minerals in a significant amount. Production and processing of these minerals have become important to form a basis for new technologies and fulfill the needs of human beings. However, its adverse impact on the environment cannot be neglected. Business competition in the mining sector led to rapid extraction of ore and depletion of minerals from the earth basin. CO2 and other toxic gases released from ore extraction and processing are contributing to global warming. Mineral processing requires highly toxic chemicals in the leaching process which directly put forward the demand for chemical manufacturing and transportation. For example, gold mining requires Sodium Cyanide, Hydrochloric Acid, Sodium hydroxides in the gold leaching process. Waste generated through gold mines is strongly toxic and harmful to flora and fauna. If not managed properly, mined waste can be harmful to the environment in many ways. Human health can also be greatly impacted by the regular exposure to toxic chemicals, airborne gases, dust in the mining industry. Long-term exposure to these chemicals can cause cancer, biological issues, mental health issues, etc. Therefore, it is important to measure the mining industry’s environmental footprints, such as greenhouse gas emission, energy use, human toxicity, ozone depletion, resources use, material scarcity, fossil resources scarcity, at various stages of its life. However, quantifying the life cycle environmental impacts of mining industry is still underexplored.

Different return-period design floods are standard criteria for designing structural measures. Recently, risk-based flood management has received a significant appraisal, but the fixed return period is still the de facto standard for flood management designs due to the absence of a robust framework for risk-based flood management. The objective of this paper is to discuss the economics and criteria of project appraisal, as well as to recommend the most suitable approach for a risk-based project feasibility evaluation. When it comes to flood management, decision-makers, who are generally politicians, have to prioritize the allocation of resources to different civic welfare projects. This research provides a connection between engineering, economics, and management. Taking account of socioeconomic and environmental constraints, several measures can be employed in a floodplain. The Kaldor–Hicks compensation principle provides the basis for a risk-based feasibility analysis. Floods should be managed in a way that reduces the damage from minimum investments to ensure maximum output from floodplain land use. Specifically, marginal losses due to flood damage and the expense of flood management must be minimized. This point of minimum expenses is known as the “optimum risk point” or “optimal state”. This optimal state can be estimated using a risk-based assessment. Internal rate of return, net present value, and benefit–cost ratio are indicators that describe the feasibility of a project. However, considering expected annual damage is strongly recommended for flood management to ensure a simultaneous envisage of the performance of land-use practices and flood measures. Flood management ratios can be used to describe the current ratio of expected annual damage to the expected annual damage at the optimal risk point. Further development of the approach may replace probability-based standards at the national level.', 1, 1, 0, '', 0),

The intermittency and unpredictability of these resources impact real-time operations. This is typically addressed by operating thermal generators with substantial headroom (below efficient operation) such that they can rapidly replace a sudden loss of renewable energy supply brought on by cloud cover or other factors. The amount of power that is available from these online, low-loaded generators is known as operating reserve (traditionally spinning reserve). Accurate net load forecasting could help to reduce the amount of operating reserve needed to ensure grid stability under conditions where the solar resource is forecast to be highly stable/reliable such as on clear sky days. This would result in more efficient generator operation and lower overall energy costs. This thesis aims to develop a method of optimising the operating reserve requirements using net load forecasting models. The operating reserve requirements today are deployed statically and so do not allow for a reduction in the regulating reserve component where weather conditions are highly predictable and thus so solar generation.
