(2, 'Enhancing airport screening using a deep neural network algorithm', 'The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has a complex security program that requires officers to visually search travelers’ baggage for prohibited objects, or cues to such objects, which may pose a threat to security. This visual search - when conducted by humans - is difficult to successfully complete as it may result in either a false positive (finding a non-threatening object) or a false negative (missing a threatening object); indeed, a recent assessment reported that TSA screeners missed 95% percent of mock explosive and banned weapons smuggled through checkpoints (ABC News, 2015). It is possible that effective screening may be achieved via the coupling of human screeners and detection technology. Here, the proposal is to design an algorithm that analyses x-ray images during baggage (and/or person) screening to automatically give an alert when a potential threat is detected. The challenge is to utilise deep neural networks to aid with image and object recognition; specifically, to detect the presence of a threat within compact, cluttered and diverse baggage content in a timely-manner, thus providing travel safety assurances.\n\nPotential issues that require solutions:\n1.	Utilise a machine learning framework – based on convolutional neural networks, for example - that processes images captured either by checkpoint baggage screeners or body scanners then detects threatening objects. These objects are usually intentionally obscured by other items, thus a computer algorithm that automatically identifies threat is useful in reducing the risk of misdetection during the physical inspection of the x-ray image. The detection must be rapid and accurate, potentially with a better performance rate than that of human screeners, in order to reduce the amount of work done by a human inspector.\n2.	Develop an algorithm that identifies regions within the images captured either by checkpoint baggage screeners or body scanners that may include threatening objects. This alternative solution enables the human screener to then review only the alerted regions of the image, thus not only reducing the amount of time they need to scan the entire image for a potential threat, but also enabling them to focus all cognitive effort on alerted regions.\n3.	Minimise the false alarm rate when detecting non-threatening objects in images captured either by checkpoint baggage screeners or body scanners. This point is pertinent as it would reduce the need for checkpoint workers to pull passengers aside for further inspection.', 1, 1, 0, '', 0, '', 0),
(4, 'Augmented Reality System on Improving Safety of Young Drivers', 'Young drivers (L- and P-platers) are over-represented when examining car-related deaths in Australia. This over-representation may stem from young drivers’ lack of experience with searching dynamic and complex visual environments in order to detect task-relevant items, including traffic signs, pedestrians and other cars, or gauging distances between their own car and others (i.e., depth perception). Augmented-reality may serve as an effective tool that enhances the driving performance of young drivers by graphically overlaying visual information - that young drivers may miss or find difficulty calculating in their environment - onto the real world. The challenge here is, therefore, to design an augmented-reality interface that can increase the situational awareness (ability to recognise task-relevant items), and, thus, improve the decision- making (safe driving) of young drivers without increasing their cognitive or perceptual workload.\n\nPotential issues that require solutions:\n1.	Identify the difficulties that young drivers may face whilst driving in Australia.\n2.	Develop an augmented-reality head-up display that would help resolve the difficulties.\n3.	Improve the usability of the augmented-reality platform by making it multi-sensory (visual and auditory display).', 1, 1, 0, '', 0, '', 0),

This is probably what some buyers on eBay are doing when they wait until the final seconds of an auction to bid (Roth, 2007)\nThe Internet has only increased the rate at which new markets, including dating and job markets, arise and grow in size and importance. Probably the most active auctions in the world are those conducted to link ads to Internet search terms. Which ads appear every time someone does a Google search, for example—and the order in which they appear—depends on which sponsors win a match to those search terms in an auction conducted automatically by Google at the time of each search.) Every new market has to attract enough participants and then help those participants cope with the resulting congestion. And markets like eBay need to convey information about sellers, not just products. The proliferation of new kinds of markets will enhance not only our economic life but also our understanding of markets in general (Roth, 2007)\nThis thesis will investigate the role of entrepreneurial ventures and entrepreneurs in market design. The thesis will investigate whether current global challenges such as education or healthcare could be addressed from an entrepreneurial perspective and will investigate whether individual entrepreneurial ventures would accommodate for the challenges in market design or this venture better suited for organizational entrepreneurial ventures', 1, 1, 0, '', 0, '', 0),

Due to the ever-changing nature of information security risks, employees’ awareness and security compliance are integral to the effective development of information security programs by the organization. The identification of personal and organizational factors that motivate individuals’ security compliance is essential to the overall effectiveness of organizational security initiatives. Organizations often implement a wide range of security measures to protect their information and other resources and assets. \nEmployees expect security task to have minimal effects on their primary tasks in the organization and expect burden-free engagement for security compliance. Consequently, when the security procedure interferes with the primary task, a user may ignore or even interfere with the security measures, since the user is more focused on the task and the end rewards associated with completion of the primary task (Adams et al. 1999).\nThe burden of compliance with security tasks on employees has been identified as one of the major factors leading to non-compliance (Furnell et al. 2012a; Leach 2003; Vance et al. 2012a). However, few studies have examined the factors that influence security compliance burden and how it affects security compliance.

Recently, risk-based flood management has received a significant appraisal, but the fixed return period is still the de facto standard for flood management designs due to the absence of a robust framework for risk-based flood management. The objective of this paper is to discuss the economics and criteria of project appraisal, as well as to recommend the most suitable approach for a risk-based project feasibility evaluation. When it comes to flood management, decision-makers, who are generally politicians, have to prioritize the allocation of resources to different civic welfare projects.

The Kaldor–Hicks compensation principle provides the basis for a risk-based feasibility analysis. Floods should be managed in a way that reduces the damage from minimum investments to ensure maximum output from floodplain land use. Specifically, marginal losses due to flood damage and the expense of flood management must be minimized. This point of minimum expenses is known as the “optimum risk point” or “optimal state”. This optimal state can be estimated using a risk-based assessment. Internal rate of return, net present value, and benefit–cost ratio are indicators that describe the feasibility of a project.

(195, 'Optimisation of operating reserve procedures using net load forecasting in a power system with high behind the meter solar penetration', 'Power System operators today are adapting to an increasing contribution from renewable resources including behind the meter solar. The intermittency and unpredictability of these resources impact real-time operations. This is typically addressed by operating thermal generators with substantial headroom (below efficient operation) such that they can rapidly replace a sudden loss of renewable energy supply brought on by cloud cover or other factors. The amount of power that is available from these online, low-loaded generators is known as operating reserve (traditionally spinning reserve). Accurate net load forecasting could help to reduce the amount of operating reserve needed to ensure grid stability under conditions where the solar resource is forecast to be highly stable/reliable such as on clear sky days. This would result in more efficient generator operation and lower overall energy costs. This thesis aims to develop a method of optimising the operating reserve requirements using net load forecasting models. The operating reserve requirements today are deployed statically and so do not allow for a reduction in the regulating reserve component where weather conditions are highly predictable and thus so solar generation. The Alice Springs power system will be used as a case study to identify additional parameters and models to predict high confidence situations using historical data dynamically determine operating reserve requirements.', 1, 1, 0, '', 0, '', 0),
